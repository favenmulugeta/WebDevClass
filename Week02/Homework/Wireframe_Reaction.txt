Wireframes seem incredibly valuable. They give designers the freedom to experiment and rearrange their UI without the pressure of finalizing details. They ensure you're addressing the right problems, especially since different design teams approach projects in unique ways. Thanks to their simple structure, wireframes offer a low-risk environment for making adjustments and refining ideas. They provide a clear sense of the layout and composition, without needing to worry about colors, design elements, or image sizes. Wireframes also open the door for peer feedback, allowing you to further fine-tune the design. Ultimately, they help you gain clarity on the project's purpose, the problem it's solving, and where it will go live.
