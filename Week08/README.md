# HW Week08: Due Tuesday Week09

Complete your midterm projects. You will be presenting either Tuesday or Thursday. All students must be prepared to present by Tuesday, presentation order will be randomly generated at the start of class Tuesday. ALL students are expected to be present for both presentation days. If you present and Tuesday and decide to be absent Thursday, it will negatively affect your midterm grade!

Please be sure to document your project with either a slideshow or a markdown file inside your class repo. Be sure to include:

- A demo of the site and the progress you have made
- A snippet of code you figured out (perhaps a tutorial you found or some responsive behavior you figured out)
- Be sure to include at least one media query in your CSS for responsive behavior. If you are only picking one media query, make sure it is mobile `(max-width: 768px)`. I will be asking you to resize you screen when you demo!
- Next steps (if you had more time, or if you plan on continuing to add functionality for your final)
- Your midterm project code and documentation (and copy of slideshow if applicable) must be present in your repo.
- Presenation is part of your midterm grade, this is how it is marked on-time. I will not be grading your _code_ until Friday, March 21. If you make any considerable changes within the extra time, please email me so that I am aware your project may look/behave differently than when you presented.

## IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN NEXT THURSDAY

Some of you have shared with me excused absences for March 20.

- If you are excused for Thursday, but will be available Tuesday. You will present Tuesday March 18. Please be sure to email me THIS WEEKEND to let me know you need to present on Tuesday.
